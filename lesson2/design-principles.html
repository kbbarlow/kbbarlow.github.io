      <p>Park tool’s website is an excellent example of Hicks law. The website gives you two upfront choices, fix it or
        tools. This help consumers to make immediate decisions on what they are wanting to do on their website.</p>

        alt="screen capture of urabnized bikes website with a picture of women riding a bike." />
      <p>Urbanized bikes has large pictures advertising their bikes surrounded by black. The black serves as white space
        making the design very clean and easily consumable. The website is empty very clean in its navigation also. </p>

      <p>Jane is a great example of Fitt’s law because they use large button that take consumers to their desired
        destinations. They have a large shop now button. They also large pictures of categories of items that serve as
        buttons that direct consumers to what they are looking for. </p>
