        <p class="persona1">Isabel and George are engaged. They are planning their 
          honeymoon to Cozumel, Mexico. They are excited for 
          beach time but enjoy a good adventure. They are looking
          for ways to see the sites but have a good time while doing
          it. They enjoy the convenience of how small scooters are 
          and how easy they are to park. So they are looking to rent 
          scooters to get them around the island.

        <p class="persona2">Liam recently graduated from college in computer engineering.
          He recently landed a well paying job. He is celebrating his 
          success with a group of his three fellow graduates with 
          a cruise that ports in Cozumel for 2 days. He and his 
          buddies have just arrived on the island are looking 
          for fun things to do around the island for the next couple 
          days. With  a quick Google search they found scoots and 
          are now trying to figure out if they want to rent and jeep 
          or a couple of ATVs. They are super excited because they 
          found so many great options. Top of their list is the Mayan
          ruins, Zona Arqueologica San Gervasio.</p>
